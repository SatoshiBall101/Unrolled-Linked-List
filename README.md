# Unrolled Linked List

This homework project involves the implementation of the split function which takes a linked list with integer values and splits them into two linked lists; 
one with all the even numbers and the other with all the odd numbers.

The second part is the implementation of the Unrolled Linked List Class and some of its functions such as pop_front, pop_back, push_front, push_back, and getValAtLoc.
